# MP3-Player
Python code for MP3 Player
The code displays a easy to read graphical user interface on the Raspberry Pi that allows users to select their songs from the songslist within the microSD card and play it. The touchscreen feature and the ability to playback songs, skip back, and skip forward on the songslist are implemented in the code.
